            “Under construction” is a great term one might use to describe personal webpages of the 1990’s. Carpenter refers to them as possibly provisional, temporary, or one-of-a-kind, which is exactly the kind of tone I would want for my own eventual website. This writing takes any anticipatory stress or fear of imperfection out of my expectations for this coding class, and I am glad that we are reading this early on to set the tone for the semester. Anil Dash’s account of the early web definitely makes me mourn what could have been when he wrote "In the early days of the social web, there was a broad expectation that regular people might own their own identities by having their own websites, instead of being dependent on a few big sites to host their online identity."  Overall, I’m very glad theres an existing effort to make the web more accessible and hand-made.
