            First things first, I love the bing bongs. Secondly, the inclusion of the videos depicting the changing of the page formats was another great touch. Chimero’s usage of descriptive language such as ‘layers of cake’ and ‘stacked bricks’ when explaining how webpages space out and order elements was beneficial to a beginner coder like me. Explaining each concept piece by piece and divided by an explanatory video created an easy writing for me to follow and truly mentally absorb. The playful dialogue that’s included throughout the writing was also an attractive and helpful feature. I find the comparison between graphic art and webpage design to be enlightening when sorting out how small css details really elevate a webpage, and once the two are meshed in the art examples shared, css begins to make a bit noir sense to me.Concluding with an endless ocean was a great representation of a webpage’s potential.
