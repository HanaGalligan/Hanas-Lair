            Frank Chimero explains that the internet and tech hasn’t made life any less complicated, but rather complicated in a different sort of way. “...there is so much convenience, but so little comfort. Everyone is tired. Our attention is over-extended, over-stimulated, and over-commodified, making us twitchy, unfocused, and, in a very crude sense, afraid.” Things aren't only less complicated, but we seem to live within the internet in an unforeseen way. This becomes even more troubling when we recall that many of the places people congregate are hostile in their use of data collection and constant ad placement, in the event that it doesn't already cost money to access the websites. The web should be more communal and a neutral place for people to seek out knowledge, connection, and creativity. The web should be more like a “good room” or a commonwealth. Obviously marketplaces are a part of a commonwealth, but I wholeheartedly agree with Chimero that there needs to be less advertising and constant “buy buy buy” culture. Along with this, I can guarantee from experience that a digital detox is a great way to unwind and feel less wound up and twitchy.
