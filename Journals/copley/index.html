            I absolutely love the process of reading this writing. It makes me feel like I am able to take my time and really enjoy the experience of the website. The constant updates are great and create the feeling of being in correspondence with another person messaging me. Having a variety of writings being constantly updated was also very unique and immersive. My favorite writing from the site was You Are the Product, especially the part where it’s asserted that 'If you are not paying for it, you're not the customer; you're the product being sold'. An attention economy is a weird concept but makes so much sense today online, considering personal data is bought and sold constantly sometimes without our knowledge. Premeditation was another interesting piece from this writing site, and provoked a lot of thought in relation to the ‘dot dot dot’ and how it impacts my perception of a potential correspondence. The idea that human connection is converted into a profit is almost sickening and really bothers me to think even something as important and intrinsic to the human condition is still easily monetised and lucrative for a person not even involved in the conversation.
