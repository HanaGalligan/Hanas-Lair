            Seeing computer-centric art in the past has not honestly been the most exciting thing about visiting an art museum for me. Despite this, I had a blast reading through and watching the examples of artwork in The Poetry of tools.  My favorite of the works was Philippe Cao’s Ritual for Empowerment. I will always be a sucker for uplifting art, so seeing a piece that’s so interactive was very nice. Alexei Shulgin’s Form Art and Sebastian Ly Serena’s portfolio site was also very intriguing due to their thriftiness and creativity. The amount of time and thought that must have been put into them is incredibly impressive, especially to a new coder like me. Overall, this catalog was very inspiring to look through and gave me a lot of ideas for future projects.
