            The understanding that social media can be a nerve wracking experience has never been lost on me, but I could never figure out exactly what about the experience beyond the social aspect made it so painful to navigate. Laurel Schwulst’s explanation that there’s a residual lack of clarity due to the general ad bombardment we all come to expect from most websites really made it all click for me. The insistence that a website is never truly finished was also a great thing of clarity as well as relief. Thinking of websites as a living space, a comfortable space that I can furnish, was especially exciting to me as I begin my coding journey. Putting more thought into the dimensional and spatial context of a website allows me to get comfortable with starting out, when I was previously incredibly daunted by what I thought a website had to be. Affirming that a website doesn’t need to be rushed, perfect, or complete was the best foot to step into the coding world with.
