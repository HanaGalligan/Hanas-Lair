            The first thing that comes to mind when I think about technology are flashing buttons, chrome, and lasers. Futuristic or modern contraptions with mysterious compositions and parts that I wouldn't really be able to comprehend. Reasserting the true meaning of technology in Le Guin’s writing makes the tech world seem to open up. “Technology is the active human interface with the material world.” was particularly clarifying for me. Asking myself if i know how to make something is what truly separates the complicated technology from the uncomplicated, and adds so much more value, mystery, and importance to “basic” technology that I wouldn’t have originally attributed it with. A wicker basket is just as much technology as a calculator, when looking at them through the lens of utility.
